# Running It on SHAI — who does what

**SHAI** (meetshai.com) is a team of 97 specialist agents in 11 squads. Sundae talks to it
through one concierge — the portal, a phone call, text, Slack or email. It plans, builds,
posts, books and reports across the tools Sundae already uses, and **asks before anything
it can't undo**: spending, sending to someone new, publishing, deleting. It runs on Sundae's
own model key (the AI vendor bills Sundae directly, no markup), meters every run, and
commits everything it builds into Sundae's own GitHub.

**Recommended plan: Business — $497/month** (or $4,970/year): up to 5 businesses/workspaces,
team seats with per-business permissions, phone + SMS from SHAI (650 texts and 10 hours of
calls a month), 3-day free trial. One Sundae workspace covers the membership engine; add a
workspace per region later if regional teams want their own approvals.

**What Sundae connects once** (setup wizard, about 10 minutes plus approvals):
GoHighLevel (CRM, funnels, calendars, SMS/email, AI agents) · Meta Business (ads + Pages +
Instagram) · Google Ads · LinkedIn (company page; Josh posts himself) · Google Calendar
(Victoria's team) · Twilio or GHL phone (A2P 10DLC registered) · GitHub + Vercel (the three
sites) · the AI model key · optionally Instantly (cold email), Slack.

## 4. The approval model (why this is safe to run daily)
- **Asks first:** any ad spend change, any message to a new contact, any publish, any delete.
  Josh or Victoria approve by text ("YES"), by button, or by phone.
- **Daily ceiling:** a hard daily AI spend ceiling across providers. A run that would cross it
  pauses for approval.
- **Compliance in code** for texts, calls and commercial email: consent, opt-outs, quiet
  hours (8 AM–9 PM recipient time), unsubscribe + postal address, and AI disclosure whenever
  SHAI talks to someone who isn't you.
- **Ownership:** everything SHAI builds is committed to Sundae's GitHub; data exports any time.

## 5. Weekly time required from Sundae once it's running

| Person | Time | What |
|---|---|---|
| Josh | ~3 hrs/week | 60 min on camera (batch), 20 min/day LinkedIn, approvals by text, one dinner/month |
| Victoria's team | Calls | Intro calls, discovery, FDD process — SHAI fills the calendar |
| Marketing lead | ~5 hrs/week | Review drafts, approve posts/ads, own the dinner logistics |
| SHAI | Daily | Everything else: building, posting, ads, follow-up, reporting |
